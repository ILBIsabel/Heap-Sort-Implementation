Algorithm Implementation: Developed a comprehensive Heap Sort algorithm, which includes functions for swapping elements, heapifying subtrees, and performing the overall heap sort on an array of integers.

Heapify Function: Implemented a recursive heapify function to ensure that each subtree rooted at a given index maintains the heap property by comparing and swapping elements as necessary.

Sorting Mechanism: Built a max heap from the input array and repeatedly extracted the maximum element, placing it at the end of the array, and reducing the heap size to sort the array.

Demonstration Program: Created a main program to showcase the algorithm, which includes initializing an array, printing the original array, performing the heap sort, and printing the sorted array.
